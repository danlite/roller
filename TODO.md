- TESTS
- reroll individual inputs
- better multi-roll-count bundle behaviour
  - hide unnecessary header row
    - this probably also fixes rerolling with dynamic (from context) rollCount value
    - clean up nested code
- simpler nested results state?
- "pass-through" tables?
  - e.g. for:
    - Perilous Wilds: Creature -> Humanoid -> Humanoid -> [Humanoid -> Common] -> Common (collapse the [])
    - selectable tables like XGTE life decisions Class+Background tables, or MCDM S&F Special Allies table
  - how to model/display?
    - collapse horizontally?
- multi-dimensional tables? (SKT)
